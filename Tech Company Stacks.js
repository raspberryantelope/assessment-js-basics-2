//The only guidelines for this document were the ones on the rubric, and I wasn't sure it's looking for specific languages (i.e. Java, Python, a MERN stack, etc.) or descriptions of the technologies. Adobe and Microsoft only give more vague info anyway.


/* Adobe:
        Adobe describes their stack as "five functional layers", which are:
            -Cloud Infrastructure -- they list either AWS or Azure for IaaS foundations
            -Platform as a Service -- Adobe commerce provides PaaS environments for testing and integrating services
            -Adobe Commerce -- this provides a "pre-provisioned infrastructure" that includes PHP, SQL, and other database and search technologies.
            -Performance Tools -- this layer provides debugging. monitoring, and management tools for the application(s)
            -Content Delivery Network -- This is a featureset that includes CDN, and includes DDoS Protection, PCI Compliance, and Image Optimization

Microsoft Azure:
        Since Microsoft has a ton of different stacks listed on their website, I'll focus on Azure specifically:
            -Azure is a set of cloud services offered by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services in the cloud. There are many different
            facets to Azure, but the most known are:
                -Compute Services -- Azure provides a set of compute services for building, testing, and deploying applications. These include:
                    -Virtual Machines (VMs) -- the physical servers that run applications
                    -Databases
                    -Storage
                -Networking -- a set of networking services for connecting your applications to the internet
                -Identity and Access Management -- a set of "access management services" for managing user access to applications
                -Deployment -- Azure also provides a set of deployment services for deploying applications


Spotify:
        Spotify actually has a super cool backend that uses a lot of nifty tricks to work as well as it does.
            -Backend
                Spotify's backend is focused on microservices, which allows for huge scalability. Spotify lists a bunch of different tech they use, including:
                    - Java
                    - Scala
                    - Node.js
                    - Apache Kafka
                    - Apache Cassandra
                    - Redis
                    - Docker
            -Frontend
                Spotify's frontend mainly uses web tech, including:
                    - React
                    - Redux
                    - Sass
                    - Webpack
            -Other
                Spotify engineers also created "Scio" which is a Scala API for Apache Beam that is now a popular open source tech used by many people. */
